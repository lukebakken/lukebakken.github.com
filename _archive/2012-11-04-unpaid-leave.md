================

Much [has been said already](https://www.facebook.com/MusiciansOfTheSpokaneSymphony) about the issue of "unpaid leave" but concrete examples of
its necessity in the life of a Spokane Symphony musician can't be easily found. As an [orchestra
member](http://www.spokanesymphonymusicians.org/artist.php?name=lbakken) who does use unpaid leave every season, I'll explain my use of it as
well as its continuing necessity and expansion in the future.

The contract between the Symphony and its musicians includes unpaid leave when your "primary employment" conflicts with services with the
Spokane Symphony. This is referred to as "business leave" and allows a musician to have a full-time day job. I won't give my opinions here about
having an orchestra of "day jobbers" vs. professional musicians - that's a [separate topic in itself.](/2012/11/04/day-jobs.html) I
work as a software engineer for a cloud computing company in Seattle, WA.

Thankfully in these negotiations, business leave is not under attack, probably because it is used so rarely by other members of the orchestra.
Most of the members of the Spokane Symphony consider themselves to be professional musicians first and foremost and structure their lives to be
able to perform at their highest capacity with the symphony and make time to supplement their symphony salary with teaching and other musical work.

Since I joined the orchestra in 1999 we have had many, many new and very talented members audition and join. Some of these people decided to
uproot themselves and move to Spokane based on the salaries promised in the 2006 - 2010 contract. As said many times elsewhere - these salaries
did not come to full effect and, in my opinion, do not look as though they will come into effect in the near future.

What options do these talented orchestra members have to make up pay and continue to stay in Spokane? My wife, Margaret Bowers, plays 4th chair
in the first violin section. She and several other members of our orchestra have auditioned for and are on the substitute list for other,
higher-paying ensembles in the Seattle area - including the Seattle Symphony. In fact, no small part of the Seattle Symphony's violin substitute
list is made up of members of the Spokane Symphony!

Imagine that - we have musicians in our small-town orchestra who are talented enough to edge out musicians in a major metropolitan area for
spots on the substitute list of a major symphony orchesta. This is a part of why the Spokane Symphony performances sound so good.

In addition, working for a week in Seattle pays much, much more than a week of musical work in Spokane. As long as Spokane Symphony musicians
are given *unpaid leave* to take work, when available in Seattle or other metropolitan areas, we have a win-win situation for everyone. These
musicians can hope to make up wages that have been frozen for years and appear to be on the chopping block, the Spokane Symphony can keep these
musicians among its ranks and future candidates for openings in the Spokane Symphony can rest assured that they will not be trapped in Spokane
for the duration of their tenure here.

In other words, we would be treating the musicians of the Spokane Symphony as though their "primary employment" is *being a professional
musician*.

Unfortunately, the management of the Spokane Symphony does not see the situation in this way. Their contract proposals severely limit the amount
of unpaid leave a musician in the symphony can use to perform better-paying musical work elsewhere. They have given us several reasons, which I
will examine here:

* "We make a commitment to the musicians and expect one in return"

The 2006 - 2010 contract represented both an increased commitment from the organization as well as a path towards a true, full-time orchestra
(for the 35 core members) in Spokane. A commitment like this can expect and did receive a commitment back from the musicians.  However, due to
many factors, the financial commitment stalled in 2008 and appears to be destined to be reduced. The only fair course is to allow members of the
orchestra who *can* find better-paying musical work elsewhere the flexibility to do so when the opportunity arises.

Orchestras with a base pay of around $24,000 and up a year do restrict the amount of unpaid leave a musician can take. This is a reasonable
expectation given the financial commitment to the musician.

* "It could negatively effect the quality of the performances in Spokane"

Yes, this is concievable, but unlikely. First, any agreement to allow unpaid leave would have reasonable and fair restrictions on the number of
musicians granted unpaid leave at any one time. Second, the number of musicians who are able to find this work is a small part of the orchestra,
but they are members that the symphony should be trying every method possible to keep in Spokane - even if it means that for a few concerts
some of these musicians will not be present.

Also, I will argue [in this post](/2012/11/04/day-jobs.html) that this situation is preferable to one in which a significant portion of the
orchestra also has full-time day jobs.

* "There could be extra costs involved"

This is true as well - sometimes substitute musicians must be given travel pay (which has a limit of $200 for the week) to come to Spokane to
fill in. This is a "fact of life" for an organization that is so geographically isolated. The list of substitutes is agreed upon between the
Music Director and Principal of each section before the season starts and concerns about out-of-town substitutes can be and should be addressed
at this point in time.

I hope that a reasonable agreement can be reached that allows Spokane Symphony musicians to be professional musicians. If the salary levels can
not be increased to accomplish this, other compromises must be made to retain the musicians we have now and to be able to attract candidates in
the future.
