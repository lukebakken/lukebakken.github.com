================

* From the Society's mission statement: [The Society provides professional orchestral performances...](http://www.spokanesymphony.org/11,mission)

* The Society accomodates people with full-time *non-musical* day jobs with a generous unpaid leave policy. As [I pointed out
  here](/2012/11/04/day-jobs.html), this is in conflict with having an orchestra of *professional musicians*. Why is the Society OK with "day
  jobbers" but is unwilling to support people being *professional musicians*? (except for the Music Director...)

* The Society provides its Music Director, Eckart Preu, the [opportunity to pursue outside musical work as Music Director in Stamford,
  CT](http://www.stamfordsymphony.org/about/musicDirector.html) and he actually gets paid a good salary that allows him to focus 100% on being a
  professional musician. The Spokane Symphony orchestra members aren't anywhere near that salary so [why not allow them to augment their
  salaries with outside musical work when those opportunities arise?](/2012/11/04/unpaid-leave.html)

* The unpaid leave policy of the Spokane Symphony, both in the past and in the current proposal, is [out of line with national
  norms.](/2012/11/09/fair-leave-policy.html)
