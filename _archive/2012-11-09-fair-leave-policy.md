================

In a [previous post](/2012/11/04/unpaid-leave.html) I outlined an argument supporting a more flexible unpaid leave policy for Spokane Symphony
musicians who face a declining salary commitment from the Society. In this post I will examine the leave policies of orchestras with a similar
overall budget size as the Spokane Symphony. As always, anything presented in this blog is 100% my own opinion and should not be construed as
the opinion of anyone but yours truly.

Nationally there are some variations in leave policies, both paid and unpaid, but the general rule of thumb is this: the smaller the salary, the
more unpaid leave granted during the season. This is fundamental to a fair contract because musicians have to be able to make enough money to
continue being professional musicians. The Spokane Symphony has a very lenient unpaid leave policy for *business leave*, which is great, but as
I also pointed out [there is nothing special about an orchestra of "day jobbers"](/2012/11/04/day-jobs.html). Other organizations recognize this
and have incorporated fair unpaid leave policies in their contracts that allow their musicians to pursue other *professional musical work*. In
fact, I would say that the Spokane Symphony's leave policies are [illogical](/2012/11/09/its-illogical.html) by not enabling and encouraging
musicians to be musicians.

In general, all of the leave policies presented here have terms and conditions that I won't delve into. They generally limit the number of
musicians taking leave to a small part of the orchestra for any given concert, they require that a suitable substitute be available, and so
forth. Rational limits that aren't out of the ordinary and that make common sense.

For comparison, here are the 2011 - 2012 statistics for the Spokane Symphony. Remember that in the Society's last proposal for 2012 - 2013 the
base salary for core is reduced to $15,132 and the unpaid leave stays at 7 services (4% of the total guarantee). Also remember that the
musicians only received this guaranteed leave as a compromise for taking one of our years of pay freezes - prior to that there was *no*
guaranteed unpaid leave!

##Spokane Symphony##

* Budget: $3,651,876
* Base Salary (Core): $17,460 ($15,132 in proposal)
* Avg Salary (Strings): $12,185 
* Avg Salary (2nd chair wind/brass): $17,793 ($15,427 in proposal)
* Unpaid Leave: 1 series guaranteed (up to 7 services), remainder at Music Director's discretion. Leave for full-time **non-musical** work is
unlimited
* Paid Leave: 3 paid sick days, accumulating to 10 over time
<br/>

##Austin Symphony##

2011 - 2012 Stats:

* Budget: $4,759,396
* Base Salary: $13,853
* Avg Salary (Strings): $13,853
* Avg Salary (2nd chair wind/brass): $13,853
* Unpaid Leave: 25% attendance
* Paid Leave: 2 paid sick days

You read that correctly - in order to keep your status as a contracted musician of the Austin symphony, you need only be available for **25%**
of the services. This leave policy recognizes that the musicians of this organization need a *lot* of flexibility to be *professional* musicians
and gives them unpaid leave to do so.

##Tuscon Symphony##

2011 - 2012 Stats:

* Budget: $3,445,367
* Base Salary: $10,786
* Avg Salary (Strings): $7,972
* Avg Salary (2nd chair wind/brass): $12,262
* Unpaid Leave: **35% of services can be missed**
* Paid Leave: 6 paid sick days
<br/>

##Charleston Symphony##

2011 - 2012 Stats:

* Budget: $1,919,173
* Base Salary: $16,000
* Avg Salary (Strings): $16,000
* Avg Salary (2nd chair wind/brass): $16,000
* Paid Leave:
  * Non-illness: 5 services, 1/2 unused carries over, no limit based on concert type
  * Sick Leave: 2 annual, accumulates to 48 (!). Paid parental leave.
* Unpaid Leave: Considered by Music Director "not unreasonably denied"

Here's an orchestra with a much smaller budget than the Spokane Symphony that provides *paid* leave and an unpaid leave language similar to the
Spokane Symphony's "business leave" policy.

It's clear that the current unpaid leave policy of the Spokane Symphony needs revision and expansion if the organization wishes to retain its
current membership. It's pretty [illogical in its current state.](/2012/11/09/its-illogical.html)
